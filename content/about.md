July Fourth by Grandma Moses

My name is Art Steinmetz.  I attended an R conference where an axiom as presented that the value of information "still" on your computer is approximately zero and the value of information out in the world is infinitely more.  Even if it is small that's infinitely more than zero, right?  That emboldended me to put stuff "out there."  Perhaps someone else might find it interesting. At a minimum this blog forces more rigor in my own thinking.

I am not a data scientist. Others have coined good terms like "Data Nerd" and "Citizen Data Scientist."  I'll coin another: "Outsider Data Scientist." I would style myself in the likeness of an "outsider" artist, Grandma Moses. She was an American artist who didn't pick up a brush between childhood and old age, and had no formal training.  The works she produced would never be mistaken for the old masters' but they had a certain charm.  Perhaps I might strive for that.


This is a personal side project in no way associated with my company. My opinions here are mine alone and any data I present here is neither proprietary to my employer nor is it warranted to be correct or accurate.  Nothing I say here should be construed as investment advice.

I also serve as a trustee of the National Museum of Mathematics, [MoMath.org](http://momath.org), where I rub shoulders (though not in creepy way) with people who are really, really smart.  Visit the museum when you are in NYC.  We are making math cool!
